        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Broth
                    <ul><li>In a large pot, bring the pork or chicken broth to a simmer over 
                        medium heat. Allow it to bubble gently for about 20-30 minutes 
                        to enhance the flavors. Skim off any impurities that rise to 
                        the surface.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cook the Noodles
                    <ul><li>While the broth simmers, cook the ramen noodles according to the 
                        package instructions. Make sure to cook them al dente to maintain a 
                        pleasing texture. Once cooked, drain the noodles and set them aside.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Prepare the Toppings
                    <ul><li>In the meantime, prepare the toppings for your Naruto Ramen. Slice 
                        the roasted pork into thin pieces, peel and halve the soft-boiled eggs, 
                        and gather the sliced bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and 
                        nori strips.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Season the Broth
                    <ul><li>Taste the simmering broth and season it with soy sauce, salt, and 
                        pepper to your preferred taste. Adjust the flavors as needed to 
                        achieve the desired balance of savory and umami.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Assemble the Ramen Bowls
                    <ul><li>Divide the cooked ramen noodles into individual serving bowls. 
                        Ladle the hot broth over the noodles, ensuring they are fully submerged. 
                        Arrange the slices of roasted pork, soft-boiled eggs, bamboo shoots, 
                        bean sprouts, green onions, and nori strips on top of the noodles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Customize and Serve
                    <ul><li>Feel free to add additional toppings or condiments according to your 
                        preference. Some popular options include spicy chili oil, sesame seeds, 
                        or a drizzle of sesame oil. Serve the Naruto Ramen hot and garnish with 
                        extra green onions and nori strips for a visually appealing presentation.
