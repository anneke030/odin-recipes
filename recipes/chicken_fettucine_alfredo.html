    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook fettuccini in a pot of salted water (4 qts water, 1 Tbsp salt,) 
                    according to package instructions then drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, slice chicken into strips and season all over with salt 
                    and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp olive oil over medium/high 
                    heat and sauté chicken until lightly golden and cooked through (5 min). 
                    Remove chicken from the pan and cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>In the same pan over medium/high, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp of 
                    butter. Add onion and sauté 3 min until soft. Add sliced mushrooms and 
                    sauté until soft (5-7 min), stirring frequently. Add garlic and sauté 
                    30 seconds, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Add half-n-half and simmer over medium/high heat 8-10 min, or 
                    until beginning to thicken. Add chicken back to the pan, add 1/4 
                    cup parsley and season sauce to taste (1/2 to 1 tsp salt and 1/4 
                    tsp pepper).</li>
                <li>Add cooked pasta and stir to combine. Heat another minute until warmed 
                    through then turn off the heat, cover and let rest 10-15 minutes then 
                    stir and serve garnished with parsley.</li>
            </ol>
             <p><strong>Note:</strong> *To substitute half and half, use equal parts of milk and heavy cream. 
                 If you prefer a thicker creamier sauce, you can use heavy whipping 
                cream instead
